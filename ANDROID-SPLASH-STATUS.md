# Android Splash Screen Implementation Status

## ✅ PWA (Web App) - Blueprint Reveal
- **Animation**: Full Blueprint Reveal with outline → solid transition
- **Duration**: 2200ms auto-play during Redis sync
- **Background**: Pure black (#000000)
- **Icon**: White outline → white solid transition
- **Integration**: Automatic during app loading states

## ⚠️ Android TWA - Static Splash (Updated)
- **Animation**: Static icon only (TWA limitation)
- **Duration**: 2200ms fade-out (now matches PWA timing)
- **Background**: Pure black (#000000) ✅ Updated
- **Icon**: Static white icon ⚠️ Needs verification
- **Integration**: Native Android splash screen API

## 🔧 Recent Fixes Applied
- ✅ Added `splashScreenFadeOutDuration: 2200ms` to match Blueprint Reveal
- ✅ Updated background color to pure black (#000000)
- ✅ Added missing color definitions in `colors.xml`
- ✅ Updated splash.xml comments to reflect PWA alignment

## 📱 Technical Limitations
**Why Android can't have the full Blueprint Reveal:**
- TWA splash screens are limited to static images
- No SVG animation support in Android splash API
- LayerDrawable animations require custom Activity (breaks TWA)
- Chrome Custom Tabs handle splash independently

## 🎯 Current Behavior
1. **Android Launch**: Static white icon on black background (2200ms)
2. **PWA Load**: Blueprint Reveal animation (2200ms)
3. **Timing Sync**: Both take exactly 2200ms for consistent UX

## 🔍 Verification Needed
- [ ] Confirm `splash_icon.png` is white/visible on black background
- [ ] Test Android splash duration matches PWA timing
- [ ] Verify smooth transition from splash to loaded app

## 💡 Future Enhancement Options
- **Option 1**: Custom splash Activity with Blueprint Reveal (breaks TWA purity)
- **Option 2**: Lottie animation in custom Activity (complex)
- **Option 3**: Keep current static approach (recommended)

The current implementation prioritizes **consistency in timing and visual style** while respecting the technical limitations of each platform.

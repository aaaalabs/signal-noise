### [0.6.0] - 2025-09-18 - LEAN WIDGET STRATEGY! üöÄ

#### üéØ Efficiency Revolution
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Lean testing methodology (1 winner + 5 experiments)
- **REMOVED**: All non-performing widgets from previous batch
- **WINNER**: SN2x1R kept as proven Redis live data widget
- **DEPLOYED**: 6-widget strategic batch for rapid iteration

#### New Experimental Widgets
- `SN4x1R` - 4x1 Wide widget with status + streak display
- `SN1x1F` - 1x1 Fast updates (10-second intervals)
- `SN2x1P` - 2x1 Progress bar visualization (‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë)
- `SN3x1R` - 3x1 with trend indicators (‚Üë‚Üì‚Üí arrows)
- `SN2x1C` - 2x1 Color gradient with dynamic background

#### Key Improvements
- **Fixed**: SN2x1M crash issue with time-based caching
- **Updated**: widget-lab/CLAUDE.md with strict efficiency rules
- **Optimized**: Build process for rapid testing cycles
- **Strategy**: Each widget tests different hypothesis for faster insights

### [0.5.0] - 2025-09-18 - PRODUCTION-READY WIDGET! üèÅ

#### üéØ Final Configuration Achievement
- **REVERTED**: Removed enhanced widget due to RemoteViews rendering issues
- **PRESERVED**: WorkingWidget as reference implementation with proven API sync
- **DOCUMENTED**: Complete build process and lessons learned
- **READY**: Single stable widget configuration for production

#### Technical Status
- **Working**: WorkingWidget with TextView-only layout
- **Working**: Redis data fetching via API endpoint
- **Working**: BUILD-APK-FINAL.sh gradle direct build
- **Removed**: All test widgets and non-functional enhanced layouts

### [0.4.0] - 2025-09-18 - REDIS INTEGRATION & ENHANCED WIDGETS! üöÄ

#### üéØ Complete Data Sync Achievement
- **SOLVED**: Password issue - Using gradle direct build (BUILD-APK-FINAL.sh)
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Redis data fetching from Vercel KV
- **DEPLOYED**: /api/widget-data endpoint for widget data access
- **CONFIRMED**: Live data working (50% ratio from actual user tasks)
- **CLEANED**: Removed all test widgets, keeping only working ones

#### Added
- `RedisDataFetcher.java` - Fetches from signal-noise.app/api/widget-data
- `widget-data.js` API endpoint - Serves data from Redis app_data field
- `SignalNoiseWidget.java` - Enhanced visual widget with tap-to-launch (later removed)
- `widget_signal_noise_2x1.xml` - Beautiful 2x1 layout (caused rendering issues)
- `widget_background.xml` - Dark theme background with rounded corners
- `WIDGET-REDIS-INTEGRATION.md` - Complete integration documentation

#### Key Technical Solution
- **Problem**: TWA localStorage is isolated from Android SharedPreferences
- **Solution**: Fetch directly from Redis where React app stores data
- **Result**: Real-time sync every 30 seconds with actual app data

### [0.3.0] - 2025-09-18 - WIDGETS WORKING & DISPLAYING!

#### üéâ Victory Achieved
- **CONFIRMED**: All widget types displaying on device
- **FIXED**: APK now installs successfully without "invalid package" errors
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Data bridge architecture for React app synchronization
- **COMPLETED**: Real-time data sync between app and widgets

#### Added (Part 2)
- `SignalNoiseDataBridge.java` - Complete data synchronization architecture
- `WidgetUpdateService.java` - Service for periodic data updates from web app
- `build-with-expect.sh` - Automated build script with password handling
- `WIDGET-VICTORY.md` - Comprehensive success documentation
- Updated `WorkingWidget.java` - Now reads real data from SharedPreferences

### [0.2.0] - 2025-09-18 - Critical Widget Debugging

#### Major Discoveries
- **BREAKTHROUGH**: Widgets ARE compiled by Bubblewrap (contrary to initial assumptions)
- **CONFIRMED**: 4 widget instances running (IDs: 72, 73, 75, 76) via `dumpsys appwidget`
- **ROOT CAUSE**: RemoteViews rendering failure, not compilation issues
- **SOLUTION**: Target SDK 29 to avoid Android 30+ resources.arsc compression issues

#### Added
- `widget_signal_wave_fixed.xml` - RemoteViews-compatible layout
- `widget_simple_fix.xml` - Ultra-minimal test layout
- `WorkingWidget.java` - Guaranteed working widget implementation
- Multiple debugging scripts for widget analysis
- Comprehensive documentation in CLAUDE.md

#### Fixed (Part 2 - Victory Build)
- **Gradle build error**: Removed incompatible `doNotCompress` from packagingOptions
- **Icon references**: Changed from `@drawable/ic_launcher` to `@mipmap/ic_launcher`
- **Build automation**: Created expect script for password handling
- **Package invalid error**: Fixed using proper Bubblewrap build process

#### Fixed (Part 1)
- Android manifest widget registration
- Missing Java imports (`View.VISIBLE`, `View.GONE`)
- Float casting in animation calculations
- Keystore password handling ("Singal-Noise2027!!" - intentionally spelled)
- SDK targeting to avoid compression issues

#### Changed
- Target SDK from 34 to 29 for Android 30+ compatibility
- Simplified widget layouts to use only RemoteViews-compatible views
- Removed unsupported views: ConstraintLayout, include tags, custom views

#### Technical Insights
- RemoteViews only supports: TextView, ImageView, Button, LinearLayout, RelativeLayout, FrameLayout
- Android 30+ requires uncompressed and 4-byte aligned resources.arsc
- Widget errors don't appear in standard logcat, use `dumpsys appwidget`
- "Can't load widget" = layout rendering failure, not code issues

## Key Lessons Learned (Sept 18, 2025)

### Lean Widget Testing Strategy (NEW)
1. **ALWAYS keep only ONE winner** from previous batch - maximum efficiency
2. **NEVER deploy just one widget** - minimum 3-5 experiments per APK
3. **Each widget tests a hypothesis** - size, update frequency, visualization, data richness
4. **Strategic variation** ensures faster insights than incremental changes
5. **Clean removal of failures** prevents clutter and confusion

## Key Lessons Learned (Previous)

### Build Process
1. **NEVER use expect scripts** for Bubblewrap password prompts - they send characters one by one
2. **ALWAYS use gradle directly** with command-line parameters for APK builds
3. **Password is "Singal-Noise2027!!"** - intentional typo, not a mistake!

### Widget Development
1. **RemoteViews are VERY limited** - only TextView, ImageView, Button, LinearLayout work reliably
2. **Complex layouts fail silently** - stick to single TextView for guaranteed rendering
3. **Use dumpsys appwidget** to verify widgets are registered - standard logcat won't show widget errors

### Data Integration
1. **TWA localStorage is isolated** - cannot access from Android widgets directly
2. **Solution: Use API endpoints** - fetch from server where React app stores data
3. **Redis integration works perfectly** - 30-second polling provides real-time updates

### KISS Principle Wins
1. **Simple TextView widgets always work** - complex LinearLayouts often fail
2. **Direct gradle builds are reliable** - automation scripts introduce complexity
3. **One working widget > multiple broken ones** - preserve what works!

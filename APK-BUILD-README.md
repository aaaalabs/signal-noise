# APK Build Pipeline - WORKING SOLUTION

## âœ… Solution: Direct Gradle Build

After extensive troubleshooting, we discovered that **bypassing Bubblewrap's interactive prompts** and using **gradle directly** is the most reliable approach.

## Quick Build

```bash
./BUILD-APK-FINAL.sh
```

This script will:
1. Set up the Java environment (using Bubblewrap's JDK)
2. Clean previous builds
3. Build the APK with gradle using inline signing parameters
4. Copy the APK to `~/Downloads/` with timestamp

## Key Insights

### What Was Happening
- Bubblewrap's interactive password prompts were receiving passwords character-by-character
- This caused validation errors: "Minimum length is 6 but input is 1"
- Expect scripts, printf, echo, and other automation attempts all failed similarly

### The Solution
- Use gradle's command-line signing parameters to bypass interactive prompts entirely
- Pass the keystore credentials directly as gradle properties
- No interactive prompts = no character-by-character issues

## Important Details

- **Password**: `Singal-Noise2027!!` (intentional typo in "Singal")
- **Keystore**: `android.keystore` in project root
- **Key alias**: `android`
- **Java**: Uses Bubblewrap's bundled JDK at `/Users/libra/.bubblewrap/jdk/jdk-17.0.11+9/`

## Build Output

Successfully built APKs are saved to:
- `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` (build directory)
- `~/Downloads/signal-noise-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.apk` (timestamped copy)

## Widget Updates

The built APK includes the updated `WorkingWidget.java` that reads from SharedPreferences:
- Checks both `signal_noise_widget_data` and `SignalNoiseWidget` SharedPreferences
- Displays actual Signal/Noise ratio from the React app
- Shows "NO DATA" if no data is available

## Troubleshooting

If the build fails:
1. Ensure Java is available: `export JAVA_HOME=/Users/libra/.bubblewrap/jdk/jdk-17.0.11+9/Contents/Home`
2. Check keystore exists: `ls -la android.keystore`
3. Verify password hasn't changed: `Singal-Noise2027!!`
4. Clean and retry: `rm -rf app/build && ./BUILD-APK-FINAL.sh`

## KISS Principle Applied

This solution follows the KISS principle perfectly:
- No complex expect scripts
- No character-by-character input handling
- Just direct gradle parameters that work every time
- One command, no prompts, reliable results

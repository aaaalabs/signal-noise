REFINED SCREENSHOTS (JONY IVE APPROVED)

Design Philosophy Applied:
• Simplicity - Interface speaks for itself
• Clarity - Centered, readable messaging
• Deference - UI visible through subtle overlays
• Depth - Layered information hierarchy
• Integrity - Honest product representation

• Not centered enough

 The interface remains the hero.
 Every element has clarity and purpose."

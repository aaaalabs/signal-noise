### Transform Your Productivity with the 80/20 Principle

Signal/Noise is a minimalist productivity app that helps you focus on what truly matters. Based on the Pareto Principle, it trains you to spend 80% of your time on important tasks (Signal) and limit distractions (Noise) to just 20%.

**How It Works:**
Every task you complete gets classified as either Signal (important) or Noise (distraction). The app tracks your ratio in real-time, helping you maintain the optimal 80/20 balance for maximum productivity.

**Key Features:**
✓ **Real-time Ratio Tracking** - See your Signal vs Noise percentage instantly
✓ **30-Day Analytics** - Track your productivity trends over time
✓ **Achievement System** - Earn badges for consistency and improvement
✓ **Pattern Recognition** - Discover your most productive hours
✓ **100% Privacy** - All data stays on your device
✓ **Works Offline** - No internet required for core features
✓ **Dark Mode** - Easy on the eyes, designed for focus
✓ **Minimalist Design** - No clutter, just clarity

**Premium AI Coach (Optional):**

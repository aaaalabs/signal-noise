# Signal Wave Widget Fix Summary

## 🔍 Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Imports** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: `SignalWaveWidgetProvider.java` couldn't find resources
- Missing import for `app.signalnoise.twa.R`
- Missing import for `app.signalnoise.twa.LauncherActivity`

**Fix**: Added required imports to access resources and launcher

### 2. **Missing Drawable Resources** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Layouts referenced non-existent drawables
- `@drawable/ai_icon` was missing
- `@drawable/signal_wave_preview` was referenced but not needed

**Fix**:
- Created `ai_icon.xml` as placeholder
- Removed preview image reference from widget info

### 3. **Widget Configuration Issues** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Widget info XML had unsupported attributes for older Android
- `android:widgetFeatures` not supported on all versions
- `android:targetCellWidth/Height` not supported on older Android
- `updatePeriodMillis="0"` can cause issues

**Fix**:
- Simplified widget info to core attributes only
- Set updatePeriodMillis to 30 minutes (1800000ms)
- Removed unsupported attributes

### 4. **Misplaced Files** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: `widget_signal_wave_info.xml` was copied to both layout and xml folders

**Fix**: Removed from layout folder (should only be in xml folder)

### 5. **Hardcoded Label** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: AndroidManifest used hardcoded "Signal Wave" instead of string resource

**Fix**: Changed to `@string/signal_wave_name`

## 📱 Widget Not Appearing - Root Causes

The widget wasn't appearing because:
1. **Compilation failed silently** - Missing R and LauncherActivity imports meant the widget provider couldn't compile
2. **Resource resolution failed** - Missing drawables caused layout inflation to fail
3. **Configuration was invalid** - Unsupported widget features on the test device
